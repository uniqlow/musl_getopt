I have extracted these three source code files from the MUSL source tree:
 * include/getopt.h
 * src/misc/getopt.c
 * src/misc/getopt_long.c

I have added a musl_ prefix to all externally visiable symbols created from
these source files when built as a library.
I claim no copyright on these changes.

musl as a while is licensed under the terms found in the COPYRIGHT file.

As far as I can tell, the above three source code files are licensed
under the following standard MIT license:
